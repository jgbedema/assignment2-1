Decided to commit to the leopard web model 

Requirements Refinement:
Instead of letting user pick from what is available, allow for users to list the times that they are available throughout the day/week (commitments, work, religious events, etc.)
Allowing the option for students to take classes remotely, or asynchronously as a factor in scheduling

Application System Configuration/ Adaptation of Components:
Based on the requirements listed, and the refined list, there is no model that currently exist and wish to use bits of leopard webâ€™s existing system and create new modules that allow for more accommodations
