Waterfall Model: Scheduling Systems

Requirements:
Back-end:
Database of Users, courses, Users(Student – Instructor – Admin – etc)
Scheduling Periods(Semester-by-Semester basis, Planning)
Constraints: 100 students, 10 instructors, 1 admin
System and Software Design:
User creation / User Permissions (coding / object-oriented)
Student: Access their schedule - List of classes to register - Adding/Dropping courses
Instructor : Access to roster - schedule 
Admin : add/remove users, users from courses, courses from system, search/print roster and courses
Front-end:
Web-dev / User-Interface design
Creating pages/ buttons
Implementation:
Create a main page for the user to access their info, ability to register or view classes depending on their level
Pages (Information, course list, registered classes list)
Create buttons for the user to navigate through different pages / print any of the page info

Test
Allow for other groups, people in general to test and register for any given semester if they are a student. Otherwise, can look at a sample size of students registered, or can manipulate the classes and user available.
Deploy
Upload software online or store it somewhere for reuse.
Maintenance
Allow for user feedback on a public platform (forum, social media) and adjust cater to concerns
